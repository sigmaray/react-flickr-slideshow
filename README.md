# React Flickr Slideshow

## Demo:
https://sigmaray.github.io/react-flickr-slideshow-demo/

## Functionality:
* Take beautiful of pics from flickr.com API and show them in slideshow.
* Search custom query
* Prev/Next
* Pause/Unpause
* Choose slideshow interval
* Handling network errors. If internet connection is lost, it will not stop trying to fetch images

## TODO:
* Move constants (API_KEY, CHUNK_SIZE) into separate file
* Use promises and axios in gitFlickrPicsList
* Use redux
* Use flexbox instead of tables.

Code was written in spare time (I don't have enough of it). My biggest goal was to make this code working. I see big room for improvements, a lot of refactoring can be done. No time for that, unfortunately.
