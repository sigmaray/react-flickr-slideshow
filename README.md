# React Flickr Slideshow

## Demo:
https://sigmaray.github.io/react-flickr-slideshow-demo/

## Functionality:
* Take beautiful of pics from flickr.com API and show them in slideshow.
* Search custom query
* Prev/Next buttons
* Pause/Unpause buttons
* Choose slideshow interval
* Handling network errors. If internet connection is lost, it will not stop trying to fetch images

## TODO:
* Move constants (API_KEY, CHUNK_SIZE) into separate file
* Use promises and axios in `gitFlickrPicsList`
* Use Redux
* Use flexbox instead of tables.

Code was written in spare time (I don't have enough of it). My biggest goal was to write code that works. There is large room for improvement, but unfortunately I don't have time to refactor the code.
